// Note: Image is not exported, as doing so automatically opts-in
// the Next.js Image Optimization feature, which requires a server
// or an API to work, and breaks static exports, even if no Image
// component is used.

// To use the preview Chakra+Next Image component, import it as:
// import { Image } from '@47ng/chakra-next/dist/components/image
